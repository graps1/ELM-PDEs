This repository contains code and experiments for the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18530.

`model.py` contains the base classes implementing one- and two-dimensional equivariant extreme learning machines. For the one-dimensional case, one can optionally use positional encodings of the spatial location so that the model can learn inhomogeneous systems. For the two-dimensional case, one can exploit multiple symmetries to both decrease training time and improve prediction accuracy.

The directories `ks1d`, `ks2d` and `ch2d` contain experiments on the one- and two-dimensional Kuramoto--Sivashinsky system and the two-dimensional Cahn-Hilliard equation in Jupyter notebooks. The `.npy`-files are datasets of PDE-solutions generated by shenfun (https://github.com/spectralDNS/shenfun) using `simulation.py`.

The `symmetries` directory contains code rendering the elements of figure 6 in the paper.
